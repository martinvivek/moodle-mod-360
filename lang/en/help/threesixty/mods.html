<b>360 Degree Diagnostics and Gap Analysis Tool</b></p>
<div class="indent">
This module is designed to implement a 360 degree competency analysis. This
method of assessment is also referred to as "multisource feedback." An
individual compares his or her level of ability in a predefined list of
competencies by rating themselves against a specific scenario. Each scenario
highlights a specific skill that makes up the overall competency. This same
set of questions is also answered by a set number of colleagues, clients,
bosses, etc. in order to get a full (or 360 degree) view of the skill of the
individual as perceived by others as well as him or herself.
